### SUBMISSIONS  

We invite paper submissions of three types:

* regular papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research,
  including empirical evaluation results, where appropriate;
* short papers on smaller, focused contributions, work in progress,
  negative results, surveys, or opinion pieces; and
* demonstration papers on software or resource demonstrations, e.g. of
  systems, interfaces, infrastructures, data collections, or annotations.

Papers accepted for presentation at the conference will be included in
the NoDaLiDa 2021 proceedings, which are published as part of the NEALT
Proceedings Series by Link√∂ping University Electronic Press and in the
ACL Anthology.

### SUBMISSION FORMATS

All submissions must follow the NoDaLiDa 2021 style files, which are
available for LaTeX (preferred) and MS Word and can be retrieved from the following address:

[http://nodalida2021.org/authorkit.zip](http://nodalida2021.org/authorkit.zip)

Submissions must be anonymous, i.e. not reveal author(s) on the title
page or through self-references. Papers must be submitted digitally,
in PDF, and uploaded through the on-line conference system. Paper
submissions that violate either of these requirements will be returned
without review.

The page limits for submissions are: up to eight pages for regular papers, 
and up to four  pages for short papers and demo papers. 
For all three submission types, these page limits do *not* include 
additional pages with bibliographic references.

Appendices (if part of a paper) should come after the references, and do not count towards the page limit.
Appendices are material that can be read, and include lemmas, formulas, proofs, 
and tables that are not critical to the reading and understanding of the paper. 

For camera ready versions of accepted papers, one additional page of content is 
allowed. This holds for all paper types (long, short, demo).

### DOUBLE SUBMISSION and PRE-PUBLICATION

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues must
indicate this at submission time in the Easychair submission system,
and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted to NoDALiDa
2021. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at NoDALiDa must
notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether
the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication or
presentation the papers that overlap significantly in content or
results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.

NoDaLiDA follows the [ACL policy an anonymization and anonymity period](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation).

The anonymity period for NoDaLiDa 2021 is from January 8, 2021.
