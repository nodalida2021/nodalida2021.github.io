## 23rd Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics (NoDaLiDa)

May 31 - June 2, 2021
<!--Reykjavik, Iceland-->

[http://nodalida2021.org](http://nodalida2021.org)

## CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The Northern European Association for Language Technology (NEALT) invites proposals for workshops at its bi-annual conference on human language and speech technologies. NoDaLiDa 2021 will be held between May 31 and June 02, 2021. While we were planning to hold the conference in Reykjavik (Iceland), due to the current COVID situation the conference will be held entirely online.
<!--on the campus of the Reykjavik University in Iceland. We are monitoring the ongoing global pandemic and will update the conference plans (e.g. moving to a virtual or hybrid format) as needed closer to the conference dates.-->

NoDaLiDa addresses all aspects of natural language processing, speech recognition and synthesis and computational linguistics, including work in closely-related neighboring disciplines (such as, for example, machine learning, linguistics or psychology) that is sufficiently formalized or applied to bear relevance to speech and language technologies.

We invite proposals for workshops, to be held on Monday, May 31, 2021, immediately preceding the main conference. Workshops can be either scheduled for a full day (morning and afternoon) or for half a day. Workshop proposals can be submitted in free-text form, anytime before Friday, November 20, 2020 by email to nodalida2021-workshops@googlegroups.com.

Workshop proposals must include adequate information on at least the following aspects:

* proposed workshop title
* topic and goals of the workshop
* target group and estimated attendance
* workshop organizer(s) and contact(s)
* mode of organization and program design
