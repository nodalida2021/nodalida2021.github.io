* 8th workshop on NLP for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (NLP4CALL)
* The Second Financial Narrative Processing Workshop (FNP 2019)
* Workshop on NLP and pseudonymisation
* Computational Modeling of Facial Images and Their Description (FACES 2019)
* Constraint Grammar - Methods, Tools and Applications

### SUBMISSIONS  

NoDaLiDa addresses all aspects of natural language processing, speech
recognition and synthesis and computational linguistics, including work
in closely-related neighboring disciplines (such as, for example, machine
learning, linguistics or psychology) that is sufficiently formalized or 
applied to bear relevance to speech and language technologies.

We invite paper submissions of three types:

* regular papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research,
  including empirical evaluation results, where appropriate;
* short papers on smaller, focused contributions, work in progress,
  negative results, surveys, or opinion pieces; and
* demonstration papers on software or resource demonstrations, e.g. of
  systems, interfaces, infrastructures, data collections, or annotations.

We particularly encourage the submission of papers on completed or 
on-going work, where the first author is a Master or PhD student. This should
be indicated at submission time by adding the keyword STUDENTS.

Papers accepted for presentation at the conference will be included in
the NoDaLiDa 2019 proceedings, which are published as part of the NEALT
Proceedings Series by Linköping University Electronic Press and in the
ACL Anthology.

### SUBMISSION FORMATS

All submissions must follow the NoDaLiDa 2019 style files, which are
available for LaTeX (preferred) and MS Word and can be
retrieved from the following address:

[http://www.nodalida2019.org/authorkit.zip](http://www.nodalida2019.org/authorkit.zip)

Submissions of regular (and short) papers must be anonymous, i.e. not reveal author(s) on the title
page or through self-references.  The anonymization of submissions for demo papers is optional. If authors choose to remain anonymous, it is their responsibility to take every measure to conceal potentially identifying information.

Papers must be submitted digitally,
in PDF, and uploaded through the on-line conference system. Paper submissions that violate either of these
requirements will be returned without review.

The page limits for submissions are: up to eight pages for regular papers, 
and up to four pages for short papers and demo papers. 
For all three submission types, these page limits do *not* include 
additional pages with bibliographic references.

### DOUBLE SUBMISSION and PRE-PUBLICATION

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues must indicate this at submission time in the Easychair submission system, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted to NoDALiDa 2019. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at NoDALiDa must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. We will not accept for publication or presentation the papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.

NoDaLiDA follows the [ACL policy an anonymization and anonymity period](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation).

The anonymity period for NoDaLiDa 2019 is from April 30, 2019.

### SUBMISSION MANAGEMENT

the above requirements and no later than (end of day, [anywhere](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe) in the world):

**Friday, June 7, 2019**

NoDaLiDa 2019 utilizes the EasyChair conference management system for
