# 22nd Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics (NoDaLiDa)

September 30 - October 2, 2019
University of Turku, Turku, Finland

http://www.nodalida2019.org


CALL FOR PAPERS

The Northern European Association for Language Technology (NEALT)
invites submissions to its bi-annual conference on human language and
speech technologies.  NoDaLiDa 2019 will be held between Monday, 
September 30 and Wednesday, October 2, 2019, on the campus of the 
University of Turku, Finland.  


SUBMISSIONS  

NoDaLiDa addresses all aspects of natural language processing, speech
recognition and synthesis and computational linguistics, including work
in closely-related neighboring disciplines (such as, for example, machine
learning, linguistics or psychology) that is sufficiently formalized or 
applied to bear relevance to speech and language technologies.

We invite paper submissions in three kinds:

* regular papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research,
  including empirical evaluation results, where appropriate;
* short papers on smaller, focused contributions, work in progress,
  negative results, surveys, or opinion pieces; and
* demonstration papers on software or resource demonstrations, e.g. of
  systems, interfaces, infrastructures, data collections, or annotations.

We particularly encourage the submission of student papers on completed or 
on-going work, where the first author is a Master or PhD student.

Papers accepted for presentation at the conference will be included in
the NoDaLiDa 2019 proceedings, which is published as part of the NEALT
Proceedings Series by Linköping University Electronic Press. 
Negotiations are underway to include the proceedings in the 
ACL Anthology: http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/ as well.
